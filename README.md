# owl-bookstore v15

**This is a small project i'm doing to learn [OWL](https://github.com/odoo/owl)**, the Odoo JS framework and also some Odoo technical aspects. 
It consists of implementing a bookstore project that has 2 modules:


1. The **bookstore_backend** module to manage books in backend
2. The **bookstore_portal** module to show and interact with books

## How it works

- Install those modules on Odoo v15
- Create some books products
- Access books page in Odoo web portal (e.g. http://localhost:8069/books)

## Features

### bookstore_backend

- Managing books: Follows the logic behind the **product.template** model in addition with some book related fields.

### bookstore_portal

- List books
- Search books
