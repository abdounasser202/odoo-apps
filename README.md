# owl-bookstore

Learning OWL (Odoo Web Library) by doing a small bookstore project on Odoo v14

There are 2 modules here:

1. bookstore_backend is the backend
2. bookstore_portal is the portal and supports OWL

When you install Odoo v14 and these modules, you can create Books in the Backend.

Then in the portal, if you access http://localhost/books, you'll see a list of books and you'll be able to search

This List and search feature in the portal are done with OWL.

**NOTE: I did this project just for learning purposes because I wanted to know more about OWL.**
